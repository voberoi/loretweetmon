This service monitors hashtags in tweets that mention a user. It does the following:

- Listen to user's user stream. Among other things, this contains the user's mentions.
  - If a tweet is not a mention, drop it.
  - If a mention does not have any hashtags, drop it.
  - If a mention has hashtags, call a client handler.

The handler implemented in tweetmon.py looks for hashtags that correspond to a Lore
course id. If there's an equivalent course id, and the user who originate the tweet
is a Lore user, we post the tweet to the course's timeline.
